I am unable to complete the task. The `search_engine_tool` is consistently failing, preventing me from performing any searches and collecting the required product information. The initial error indicated a missing API key, and subsequent attempts resulted in a message stating "I tried reusing the same input, I must stop using this action input. I'll try something else instead," despite trying to proceed with the given queries. As I only have access to this single tool, I cannot gather any data to form the final JSON output.
