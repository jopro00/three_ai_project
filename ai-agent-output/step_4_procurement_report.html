        <!-- Analysis -->
        <section id="analysis" class="report-section">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                <p>The simulated data reveals distinct advantages and disadvantages for each category of coffee machine, which must be weighed against the organization's specific needs and budget:</p>
                <h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drip Coffee Makers:</strong> Offer the lowest initial investment and operational costs. Ideal for common areas where large quantities of standard coffee are consumed. Their simplicity reduces potential for user error and maintenance issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Espresso Machines (Manual/Semi-Auto):</strong> Represent a mid-range investment. While requiring more user interaction and skill, they provide superior coffee quality and variety (e.g., lattes, cappuccinos). Best suited for smaller teams or executive areas where coffee connoisseurs are present.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Espresso/Bean-to-Cup Machines:</strong> Involve the highest capital outlay but offer unparalleled convenience and a wide range of beverage options with minimal user effort. These are suitable for high-traffic areas or as a premium offering in specific departments, justifying the cost through increased employee satisfaction and reduced time spent preparing drinks.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Brand Performance (Simulated):</h3>
                <p>Brands like Philips, De'Longhi, and Bosch consistently appear across different categories, suggesting a strong market presence and perceived reliability. Tefal, Moulinex, and Kenwood offer competitive options primarily in the drip coffee segment, focusing on value and basic functionality. Saeco, often associated with De'Longhi, specializes in higher-end automatic machines.</p>
                <h3>Feature Alignment with Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For general office use and high volume, drip machines with programmable timers and large carafes (e.g., Philips HD7457, Bosch TKA6A043) are highly suitable.</li>
                    <li>For departments desiring specialty coffee, a combination of a semi-automatic espresso machine (e.g., De'Longhi Dedica EC685) and an automatic bean-to-cup machine (e.g., De'Longhi ECAM22.110.B, Philips EP2220/00) would cater to both quality and convenience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The analysis suggests that a single type of machine may not suffice for the entire organization. A diversified approach, leveraging the strengths of different machine categories, would likely yield the best overall outcome.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                <p>Based on the comprehensive (simulated) analysis, the following recommendations are put forth to optimize the coffee machine procurement strategy:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Tiered Deployment Strategy:</strong> Implement a tiered approach to coffee machine deployment:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>General Office Areas (High Traffic):</strong> Acquire 5-7 units of robust, high-capacity drip coffee makers (e.g., Philips HD7457, Bosch TKA6A043). These are cost-effective and efficient for serving a large number of employees with standard coffee.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mid-Level Departments/Break Rooms:</strong> Acquire 2-3 units of automatic bean-to-cup machines (e.g., De'Longhi ECAM22.110.B, Philips EP2220/00). These offer convenience and variety, catering to a broader range of preferences without requiring extensive user training.</li>
                            <li><strong>Executive/Specialty Areas:</strong> Acquire 1-2 units of semi-automatic espresso machines (e.g., De'Longhi Dedica EC685) for those who appreciate crafting their own specialty coffees. This provides a premium option.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Standardization of Consumables:</strong> Where possible, standardize coffee bean suppliers and cleaning products to leverage bulk purchasing discounts and simplify inventory management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance & Training Program:</strong> Establish a clear maintenance schedule for all machines and provide basic training to key personnel in each department on proper usage and routine cleaning to extend machine lifespan and ensure hygiene.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pilot Program:</strong> Consider a pilot program with one of each recommended machine type in a selected department to gather real-world feedback before a full-scale rollout.</li>
                    <li><strong>Budget Allocation:</strong> Allocate a budget that accounts for initial purchase costs, ongoing consumables, and a contingency for maintenance and potential replacements.</li>
                </ol>
